# üëÅÔ∏è YOUTUBE CREATION (Go to YOUTUBE DEVELOPMENT in E drive)
## npm i -D preetier to make our lines of code similar to others working on same project. and then we make a .prettierignore to avoid some files that are not to be provided tabspaces of 2 or equally .
## We create a file  called .prettierrc and write 
- {
-  "singleQuote": false,
-  "bracketSpacing": true,
-  "tabWidth": 2,
-  "trailingComma": "es5",
-  "semi": true
- }
## Then I connected database with my backend. For that I have to first create a database and then connect it through a link which I get from that , basically I have to copy that link to .env file(dotenv is a lightweight npm package that automatically loads environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object) as it contains the sensitive info and that is my database link and its password (assigned to a variable) . And we will then connect it through mongoose line mongoose.connect(`${process.env.VariableName}/${DB_NAME}) in index.js file in db folder . 
## Made utils to make them use different in files multiple times . Therefore I made the code Write once Use Anywhere.
## In utils, we are having ApiError.js , so that any error come in website , it goes through ApiError.js , for this we need to include middlewares in between them (Errror to reach ApiError.js).
## We use mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 simplifies pagination for Mongoose aggregation results, making it easier to work with large datasets.
