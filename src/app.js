//CORS is essential when your frontend (e.g., a React app) running on one domain needs to make requests to an API (backend) hosted on a different domain. Without CORS, browsers would block these requests due to the same-origin policy. For this , your website is allowed to access data of other backend through API (as the other site , backend engineers have allowed you through CORS origin or whitelistings).

    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN, //  This option specifies which origins (domains) are allowed to access your serverâ€™s resources. It can be a single origin (e.g., 'https://example.com') or an array of allowed origins.
    Credentials: true //  This option indicates that the server can include credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) in the CORS request.
